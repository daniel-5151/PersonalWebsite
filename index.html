                    <p>
                        I am a fourth-year bachelor student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. Here I learn about the implications of AI, how it works and a lot of
                        programming skills. Futhermore, am I currently on an exchange semester at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. Here I am following courses in Business and
                        Computer Science, to broaden in other subject areas. <br>
                        My passions include AI, fitness, travel and advantures. This is also why I chose my current bachelor and why I went on exchange to Canada. My goal is to finish my
                        bachelor degree this year and start on a master degree in The Netherlands. At one point after gaining some work experience I want to start my own business.<br>
                        Programming skills: Python, Git, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Javascript, PHP.

                        <p>
                            At the University of Amsterdam I had several big AI project. In two of those, I had to work on teams to solve problems for real companies. At the first project,
                            we build a model that could predict when people are going to move using a neural network. In the second project, we made a model that could predict the amount of
                            stock that was needed behind the bars at music festivals using polynomial regression. These projects taught me how to structure building an AI project and how to 
                            work woth real companies/stakeholders.

                        <p>
                            This is a project during my exchange at Simon Fraser University. This project went deep into project-management and workflow in a team. It also goes deep into the 
                            use of Github and other project productivity tools. This project really taught me how it is to work on a project at a real job and companie. It also taught me the use
                            of API's and project planning.

                        <p>
                            This was a web project made that was part of a course at the University of Amsterdam. It was a team project that focussed on the technology behind websites and
                            the web. We implemented a website for forming groups that could be used as a covid-buble. We made use of front-end, back-end and the security. This project teached
                            me a lot about webdevelopment, databases and the basics of project-management.
